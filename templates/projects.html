              VEX U requires us to design, build, and program robots to compete in challenge matches. 
              It is a competitive competition that includes 300+ teams from across the world. 
              In-person competitions require travel across the continental US. 
              Rankings from these competitions will determine if we make it to the World Championship competition.
              For the competition, we design two robots to compete in three minute challenge matches. The challenges change each year.

              The UAA Robotics Team is committed to creating a culture of collaboration. 
              Each team meeting is centered around a task structure. 
              Tasks are posted by the team leads so members can choose which tasks they can tackle. 
              This system opens the door for students to explore other disciplines, while also providing communication on what tasks need to be completed. 
              Implementing tasks ensures we are using our team members' time effectively and efficiently. 
              Team members can come to our meetings, help complete a specific task, and know that they had a direct impact on our team. 
            
            <br><br>
            
              Additionally, this task structure naturally leads to documentation. 
              Each task includes a section for taking notes and recording the outcome. 
              The main role of leads on our team is to create tasks and make sure they are documented properly. 
              We have done this because we understand the importance of documentation in team communication. 
              We need to have a clear trail of our thoughts and actions as we develop robots and win competitions. 
              This ensures that future UAA Robotics Teams have the ability to read our documentation, and build upon what we have learned. 
              Documenting also allows us to better learn from any mistakes that we make. 
              Such emphasis on documentation and learning from our mistakes will lead to a sustainable and interactive program for the future team.
